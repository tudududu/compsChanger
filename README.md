js_compsChanger

This project is an Adobe After Effects script written in ExtendScript. 
It provides a user interface (UI) panel with two main functionalities: 
1. "Prejmenovator" (Renamer): Allows users to rename compositions, folders, or files in the project using search-and-replace, append, remove, or case conversion operations.
2. "Comp settings": Enables users to modify composition properties such as width, height, frame rate (FPS), start time, and duration, including the option to apply changes to nested sub-compositions.

The script is designed to work with selected compositions in the After Effects project and includes features like resetting input fields, handling invalid inputs, and managing 2D/3D layers during dimension changes. The UI is organized into panels and groups for better separation of functionalities.
